## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

<i> What metric or metrics are you going to test? </i> 
- Additional comparable vehicle types could be tested from competitors.

<i> What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis? </i> 
- A null hypothesis could investigate whether or not the ride height (also known as ground clearance, or distance between the body of the car and the pavement) impacts the MPG.

<i> What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? </i> 
- For this hypothesis we could run it using a linear regression.

<i> What data is needed to run the statistical test? </i> 
- In order to tes this hypothesis we would need the ride height for a large number of cars.
