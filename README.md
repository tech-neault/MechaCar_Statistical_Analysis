# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Based on the results of this linear regression, three variables show that they provide a non-random variance on MPG values. These values are MPG, Vehicle Length, and Ground Clearance. 

With an r-squared value of 0.71, we can state that 71% of all predictions made with this model will be correct. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Analysis on the three lots of vehicles showed that Lots 1 and 2 are within the allowable margin. Lot 3 is not within the allowable margin. However, all three lots are within the allowable variance.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
#### Overall
p = 4.938
*Not statistically significant

#### Lot 1
p = 1
*Statistically significant

#### Lot 2
p = 0.6
*Statistically significant

#### Lot 3
p = 0.04
*Statistically significant

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

<i> What metric or metrics are you going to test? </i> 
- Additional comparable vehicle types could be tested from competitors.

<i> What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis? </i> 
- A null hypothesis could investigate whether or not the front angle of the car impacts the MPG.

<i> What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why? </i> 
- For this hypothesis we could run it using a linear regression.

<i> What data is needed to run the statistical test? </i> 
- In order to tes this hypothesis we would need the front angle for a large number of cars, from MechaCar and competitors.
